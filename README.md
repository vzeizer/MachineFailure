## Data Dictionary: Binary Classification of Machine Failures

This data dictionary describes the columns in the dataset used for binary classification of machine failures. The goal is to predict whether a machine will fail based on various operational parameters and failure flags.

| **Column Name**          | **Data Type** | **Description**                                                                                                | **Units**      | **Possible Values/Range**                                  | **Relevance to Machine Failure**                                                                    | **Potential Issues & Considerations**                                                                                                                      |
|--------------------------|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **id**                   | `int64`       | Unique identifier for each data point (observation/row).                                                      | -              | Unique integer values.                                    | **Not directly predictive**, primarily for indexing and record identification.                    | Should be unique for all rows.

| **Product ID**           | `object`      | Identifier for the product/machine being monitored. Could represent different machine types or serial numbers. | -              | Alphanumeric or string values (e.g., "L47181", "M29487", etc.). | May indicate **different machine models or batches** which could have varying failure characteristics. | Needs to be checked for cardinality. High cardinality might require dimensionality reduction or feature engineering techniques (like grouping or encoding).  Consider if it's ordinal or nominal.  Check for consistency in naming conventions. |
| **Type**                 | `object`      | Type of the machine or process.

Consider encoding methods (One-Hot Encoding, Label Encoding) for machine learning models. Check for class imbalance across different types. |
| **Air temperature [K]**  | `float64`     | Air temperature surrounding the machine during operation.                                                     | Kelvin (K)     | Continuous positive values (typically in a realistic range for industrial environments, e.g., 290K - 310K). | **Environmental factor** that can influence machine component temperatures and performance. Higher temperatures can lead to increased stress and wear. | Check for realistic temperature ranges and potential outliers (sensor errors). Consider conversion to Celsius if more interpretable for some audiences.  May have seasonal or daily patterns. |
| **Process temperature [K]**| `float64`     | Process temperature of a specific part or component within the machine.                                        | Kelvin (K)     | Continuous positive values, typically higher than air temperature as it reflects internal machine operation. | **Direct indicator of machine operating condition.** Elevated process temperature can be a sign of overheating or inefficiency, potentially leading to failure. | Compare to air temperature; a significant difference might be important. Check for outliers and realistic operating ranges for the process. Potential correlation with 'Air temperature [K]'. |
| **Rotational speed [rpm]** | `int64`       | Rotational speed of a key machine component (e.g., spindle, motor shaft).                                  | Revolutions per minute (rpm) | Integer values, likely within a defined operational range for the machine type.                  | **Operational parameter directly related to machine stress and wear.**  Excessive or inconsistent speed can contribute to mechanical failures and fatigue. | Check for typical operating speed ranges and any unexpected values.

| **RNF**                  | `int64`       | Random Failure flag.

May represent unexpected or complex failure modes. |  Understand the criteria for classifying a failure as "Random".  Check if RNF is mutually exclusive with other failure flags or if it can co-occur. |

**Key Considerations for Data Analysis and Machine Learning:**

* **Feature Scaling:** Numerical features like temperature, rotational speed, torque, and tool wear are on different scales. Feature scaling (e.g., Standardization or Min-Max Scaling) will be important for many machine learning algorithms.
* **Categorical Feature Encoding:**  'Product ID' and 'Type' are categorical features and need to be encoded into numerical representations for most machine learning models (e.g., One-Hot Encoding, Label Encoding, or potentially more advanced embeddings depending on cardinality and information content).
* **Correlation and Multicollinearity:** Check for correlations between features, especially between 'Air temperature [K]' and 'Process temperature [K]', and between 'Rotational speed [rpm]' and 'Torque [Nm]'. High multicollinearity might affect model stability and interpretability.
* **Class Imbalance:**  Machine failure datasets often exhibit class imbalance (fewer failures than non-failures). Techniques to handle class imbalance (e.g., oversampling, undersampling, SMOTE, class weights in models) might be necessary.
* **Feature Interactions:** Consider exploring interactions between features. For example, the combination of high 'Process temperature [K]' and high 'Torque [Nm]' might be a stronger predictor of failure than either feature alone.
* **Time Dependency (If Applicable):** While not explicitly stated, if the data is collected over time, consider if there is any temporal dependency or trends that might be important (though 'id' being just an integer might suggest rows are independent snapshots).
* **Failure Type Flags:** The flags TWF, HDF, PWF, OSF, and RNF provide valuable insights into failure modes. Analyze their distributions, correlations with other features, and their relationship to the target variable 'Machine failure'.  Determine if they are mutually exclusive or can co-occur.
* **Domain Knowledge:** Leveraging domain knowledge about machine operation and failure modes will be crucial for feature engineering, model selection, and interpreting results.
